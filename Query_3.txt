# Query 3: In this query I first created a temp table to capture the total install cost
# for each customer account (grouped by region and excluding all enterprise customers).
# This temp table is then used to calculate the average install costs and the maximum install
# costs in each region. The HW didn't explicitly ask for avg's to be included, but I thought
# it would be helpful to see how far past the average these particular accounts had spent
# on installs.
